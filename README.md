Very simple HTTP server in python that is multi threaded. Default port is 8001. If you want port 80, you need super user access.
I use this template very often and decided to add multithreading capability.
This will only execute on python 2.7, if you want to adapt for python 3, you'll need to modify the `print` syntaxes only(i think, not tested)


There are 2 files in this project. webserver.py(multithreaded python webserver) and webserver-singlethread.py.
